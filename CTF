Who wrote the task list? 

It sounds like we are looking for a file of some sorts.  A good place to start would be FTP. From the command line I logged into their FTP server as **anonymous** and had a look around. I found 2 files of interest which could provide details to use hydra.


     ~#ftp [ip address] 21
 
A. lin

What service can you bruteforce with the text file found?

        ~# hydra -l lin -P locks.txt ssh://10.10.123.67



What is the users password? 

        ~# ssh lin@10.10.123.67


user.txt






root.txt
